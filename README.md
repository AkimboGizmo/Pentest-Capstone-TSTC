<h1>Tim Z. | Penetration Testing Capestone</h1>


<h2>TSTC Course Name: Security Assessment and Auditing "Course Passed with score: 99%"</h2>


<b>In my final semester at TSTC, I embarked on a transformative journey, diving headfirst into a Penetration Testing and Security Assessment Capstone Project. This immersive experience simulated a real-world work environment, challenging me to harness my skills in a high-stakes scenario.</b>

<b> Guided by my passion for cybersecurity, I remotely connected to a Kali Linux machine, my trusty 'Attacking Machine,' and set out to explore the intricate realm of penetration techniques. As I navigated through the network, I encountered and addressed vulnerabilities across multiple machines. This hands-on project not only tested my technical prowess but also honed my ability to think critically and strategically.</b>

<b>My Capstone Project is a testament to the knowledge I gained during my time at TSTC, showcasing my aptitude for securing digital landscapes in an ever-evolving threat landscape. It's a testament to my readiness to excel in the world of cybersecurity, where proactive defense is paramount.</b>
